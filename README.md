# CHILLER

The CHILLER (Computer-Human Interface for the Live Labeling of Emotional Responses) is aprototype, using the Raspberry Pi architecture, of an affordable and easy-to-use wearable sensor for the real-time detection and visualization of peak moments of music-evoked emotion (i.e., chills, musical frissons, “shivers down the spine”). The CHILLER is using an algorithm capable of detecting, from a real-time video of a patch of skin, one of the most reliable physiological markers of strong music-related emotional arousal: goosebumps.
